 🚀 AWS VPC Peering Project (Manual Setup)

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real‑world AWS VPC Peering implementation used to securely connect two isolated Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in a 3‑tier architecture. The setup enables private communication between EC2 instances across VPCs without using the public internet, following AWS best practices for networking, routing, and security.
This project demonstrates how to manually create and configure **VPC Peering** between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) on AWS. It covers VPC creation, subnet configuration, routing changes, security settings, and connectivity testing using EC2 instances.

S – Situation

To strengthen my networking and architecture fundamentals, I decided to build a secure and scalable 3-tier architecture similar to real enterprise environments.

T – Task

My goal was to design an architecture with strict network isolation, secure communication between tiers, and monitoring of infrastructure health.

A – Action

I created a VPC with separate public and private subnets for the web, application, and database tiers.
Configured security groups, NACLs, and routing tables to ensure least-privilege access.
Implemented VPC Peering to connect multiple VPCs securely and enabled cross-VPC communication.
Used CloudWatch dashboards and alarms to track performance metrics and system health.

R – Result

The architecture achieved strong network isolation, secure cross-tier communication, and clear monitoring visibility.
This project deepened my understanding of AWS networking, security controls, and architecture patterns used in production systems.

🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

</p>

Two VPCs were created **manually**:

- **VPC-A (Prod-VPC)**  
  CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`  
  Subnet: `10.0.1.0/24` (Public)

- **VPC-B (Dev-VPC)**  
  CIDR: `192.168.0.0/16`  
  Subnet: `192.168.1.0/24` (Public)

A **VPC Peering Connection** was created between these two VPCs to enable private communication without using the internet.

🔄 **Project Flow / Steps Performed**

 **1️⃣ Create Two VPCs**
- VPC-A (10.0.0.0/16)  
- VPC-B (192.168.0.0/16)
![VPC Architecture](VPC.jpg)

 **2️⃣ Create Subnets**
- Subnet in VPC-A → `10.0.1.0/24`  
- Subnet in VPC-B → `192.168.1.0/24`

 **3️⃣ Attach Internet Gateways**
- Create IGW for each VPC  
- Attach them to VPC-A and VPC-B

**4️⃣ Configure Route Tables**
- Associate subnets with their respective route tables  
- Add route `0.0.0.0/0` → IGW for internet access
![Route Table](route_table.jpg)

 **5️⃣ Launch EC2 Instances**
- One EC2 instance in VPC-A  
- One EC2 instance in VPC-B  
- Allow SSH (port 22)  
- Allow ICMP (ping)

**6️⃣ Create VPC Peering Connection**
- Requester: VPC-A  
- Accepter: VPC-B  
- Accept the peering request  
- Check that status becomes **Active**

**7️⃣ Update Route Tables for Peering**
- In VPC-A Routes → Add route to `192.168.0.0/16` via Peering ID  
- In VPC-B Routes → Add route to `10.0.0.0/16` via Peering ID

**8️⃣ Modify Security Groups**
- Allow inbound ICMP from the other VPC’s CIDR  
- Allow SSH if required

---

 🧪 **Connectivity Testing**
- Successfully SSH’d into EC2 instances  
- Ping from **EC2-A → EC2-B** = ✔️ Success  
- Ping from **EC2-B → EC2-A** = ✔️ Success  

This confirms that **VPC Peering is working correctly**, and both instances are communicating privately without using the internet.
